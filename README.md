# Screen Hockey

Using [Raylib-Go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go). It's simple (for now...)

Plans to add:
..* a powerup system
..* an AI opponent
..* more graphical nonsense (so it's not so plane)
..* music & sound effects
..* movement in the x-direction for paddles
..* scoring system
..* mouse controls for the paddle placement (it'll play like air hockey)
